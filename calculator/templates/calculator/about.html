            <p class="mb-4">
                Most retirement calculators assume a simple two-phase model: you save until retirement, then you withdraw. But real retirement planning is more nuanced. What about phased retirement where you work part-time? What about different withdrawal strategies in your 60s versus your 80s? What about planning for healthcare costs that escalate in late retirement?
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This tool was built because <strong>existing calculators didn't support multi-phase planning</strong>. It models:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Phase 1 (Accumulation):</strong> Traditional saving years with compound growth</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2 (Phased Retirement):</strong> Transition years with reduced income and partial contributions</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3 (Active Retirement):</strong> Early retirement with higher withdrawal rates for travel and activities</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 4 (Late Retirement):</strong> Later years with adjusted spending patterns and healthcare considerations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It provides detailed, phase-specific projections so you can see exactly how your portfolio evolves through each stage of life.
